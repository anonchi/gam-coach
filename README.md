## Set Up Your Own GAM Coach

In the [demo page](https://anonchi.github.io/gam-coach), we provide five demos with the most commonly used datasets in the algorithmic recourse literature. You can easily set up a GAM Coach for your own GAM model (with only one function call). See the [documentation](https://anonchi.github.io/gam-coach/docs/gamcoach/gamcoach.html#get_model_data) for details.
